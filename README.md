# Quiz Game using Java Swing and AWT

This is a simple quiz game implemented in Java using Swing and AWT libraries. The game presents questions to the user and evaluates their answers.

## Files

- **Quiz.java**: This file contains the logic for the quiz game. It includes methods for loading questions, presenting them to the user, and checking their answers.
  
- **QuizProgram.java**: This is the main file of the program. It initializes the GUI components, handles user interactions, and integrates the Quiz logic.

## Usage

To run the Quiz game:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler. For example:
   ```
   javac Quiz.java QuizProgram.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled program using the Java interpreter. For example:
   ```
   java QuizProgram
   ```

## How to Play

1. Upon launching the program, the user will be presented with a welcome screen and an option to start the quiz.
2. Click on the "Start Quiz" button to begin.
3. A series of questions will be presented to the user one by one.
4. Select the desired answer for each question using the provided options.
5. Once all questions are answered, the user will receive feedback on their performance.
6. Optionally, the user can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Features

- Randomized questions: The questions are presented in a random order to enhance replayability.
- Interactive GUI: The game features a user-friendly graphical interface built using Swing and AWT libraries.
- Score tracking: The user's performance is evaluated based on the number of correct answers provided.
- Restart option: Users can choose to play the quiz again without restarting the program.

## Future Improvements

- Adding a timer: Implement a countdown timer for each question to add an element of challenge.
- Multiple difficulty levels: Introduce different difficulty levels with varying complexity of questions.
- Database integration: Store questions and user scores in a database for tracking progress and comparison.
